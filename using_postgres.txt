 Postgres is like a Program on your computer as opposed to sqlite which is like a File on your computer.

 Steps:
 1) Download Postgres: this is already available on ubuntu or putty/cygwin
 2) pip install psycopg2
    a) figure out what this does!
 3) Turning Postgres on in the computer
    a) Initialize database storage area on disk
        initdb -D /Users/student/Fall2012/reverse_search/reverse_search_engine/ratings/postgres/data
    b) Starting program on computer: (will also log errors to logfile in the folder)
        pg_ctl start -D /Users/student/Fall2012/reverse_search/reverse_search_engine/ratings/postgres/data -l /Users/student/Fall2012/reverse_search/reverse_search_engine/ratings/postgres/logfile
    c) Commands:
        'jobs' checks what things are running
        'fg 1' if postgres is job 1, it will bring it to the front
        'ctrl-Z' leaves the job 1
        'bg 1' sends job 1 to the background
    d) Stopping:
        pg_ctl stop -D /Users/student/Fall2012/reverse_search/reverse_search_engine/ratings/postgres/data
4) Creating Database
    dropdb mydb



python -i model.py

engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost/search_engine')

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
 --> this gave an error. Need to make the database inside of Postgres first!

Using Postgress.app on Mac

1) Download: http://postgresapp.com/
2) psql -h localhost
3) CREATE DATABASE search_engine;
4) DROP DATABASE search_engine;
